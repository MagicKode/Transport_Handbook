            A car, or an automobile, is a motor vehicle with wheels. Most definitions of cars
            state that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels,
            and mainly transport people over cargo.[1][2] There are around one billion cars in
            use worldwide. The car is considered an important part of the developed economy.

            A bus (contracted from omnibus,[1] with variants multibus, motorbus, autobus, etc.)
        is a motor vehicle that carries significantly more passengers than an average car or van,
        but fewer than the average rail transport. It is most commonly used in public transport,
        but is also in use for charter purposes, or through private ownership.

            An aircraft (pl.: aircraft) is a vehicle that is able to fly by gaining support from
            the air. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or the dynamic
            lift of an airfoil,[1] or, in a few cases, direct downward thrust from its engines.
            Common examples of aircraft include airplanes, helicopters, airships (including blimps),
            gliders, paramotors, and hot air balloons.[2]

            A ships boat is a utility boat carried by a larger vessel. Ships boats have always
            provided transport between the shore and other ships. Other work done by such boats has
            varied over time, as technology has changed. In the age of sail, especially for
            warships, an important role was the collection of drinking water. The use of radio,
            followed by telex, e-mail, etc. has reduced and then replaced the need for written
            communications to be delivered

            A bicycle, also called a pedal cycle, bike, push-bike or cycle, is a human-powered
            or motor-assisted, pedal-driven, single-track vehicle, with two wheels attached to
            a frame, one behind the other. A bicycle rider is called a cyclist,
            or bicyclist.

            A train (from Old French trahiner, from Latin trahere, "to pull, to draw"[1])
            is a series of connected vehicles that run along a railway track and transport people
            or freight. Trains are typically pulled or pushed by locomotives (often known simply
            as "engines"), though some are self-propelled,
            such as multiple units or railcars.
